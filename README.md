Weather Report documentation
For this project, I used create react app for basic react setup to make weather report.
In the project directory, you can run:
Create-react-app [foldername]
To install and initiate nodejs module inside folder.
npm install
To get install dependencies  of project, use this code.
npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.
npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
Linting:
They are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. This is because Create React App intentionally provides a minimal set of rules that find common mistakes.

What we are looking for
This exercise is to examine your technical knowledge, reasoning and engineering principals. There are no tricks or hidden agendas. We are looking for a demonstration of your experience and skill using current software development technologies and methods. 

Please make sure your code is clear, demonstrates good practices and that the readme.md file explains how to run / build your solution. Also, detail anything further that you would like to achieve with more time. 

Your solution will form the basis for discussion in any subsequent interviews.

What you need to do
Please build a single HTML page displaying the 5 day weather forecast for a location of your choice.

We believe a good solution can be created in around 4 hours, but feel free to spend as little or as much time as you like. You do not have to complete the entire exercise.
Use the latest specs of HTML, CSS and ECMAScript to implement the solution. At this time, these would be HTML5, CSS3 and ES2016.
Use the OpenWeatherMap 5 day weather forecast API to retrieve the current 5 day weather forecast.
Give some thought to what will make a decent user experience. We would like to see something readable but with no need to go all out on sleek and flashy UI elements.
Use any supporting technologies, frameworks, package managers, starter kits, build systems and libraries that you are familiar with and feel are appropriate.
Assuming a Node.js environment with the latest version installed, please ensure that there are no globally installed dependencies required to build / run your app. If you have to have them please explain why. This avoids environment issues when trying to build your solution.
Provide a README.md file that:
Documents how to run / build / test your creation.
Documents anything you might implement with more time (features, fixes, technical debt, corrections etc.)
Submit your code into a public git repository of your choice (Github / Bitbucket etc.)
Host your code on a public web server of your choice.
Checklist

 

Please ensure you have submitted the following:

Working forecast page as per the requirements above
Clear instructions of where the solution is hosted
A README.md explaining:
How to build / run / test project
What could be done with more time
Project builds / runs / tests as per instructions
